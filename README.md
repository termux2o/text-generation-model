# Text Generation Model

This repository contains a complete pipeline for building and training a text generation model using an LSTM-based recurrent neural network. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and generating coherent text sequences.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a text generation model by:

1. Collecting text data from publicly available resources (e.g., Project Gutenberg).
2. Preprocessing the raw text data for training.
3. Building an LSTM-based text generation model using PyTorch.
4. Training the model on the dataset to learn text patterns.
5. Generating text sequences based on trained data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  - `torch`
  - `nltk`
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

The dataset for this project is collected from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). The current implementation uses the plain text format of *Pride and Prejudice*. You can replace the dataset URL with any other text resource.

## Key Sections

### 1. Environment Setup

Installs the required Python libraries and imports necessary modules for text processing and model training.

### 2. Data Collection

Fetches text data from Project Gutenberg using a provided URL. Demonstrates how to load raw text data programmatically.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

Tokenizes the text, removes stopwords, and maps words to unique integer indices for model training.

### 4. Model Definition

Defines an LSTM-based recurrent neural network (RNN) using PyTorch to generate text sequences.

### 5. Model Training

Trains the LSTM model using a CrossEntropy loss function and optimizes it with an Adam optimizer.

### 6. Text Generation

Generates new text sequences based on the trained model, showcasing the model's ability to learn language patterns.

### 7. Conclusion and Future Scope

Summarizes the project results and highlights potential improvements, such as integrating transformer models or using larger datasets.
